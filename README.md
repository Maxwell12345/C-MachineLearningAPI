# Four-Input-Exclisive-Gate-AI-Predictor___Dev-In-C-

A completely from scratch C++ developed AI predicts the output of a given set of specific inputs.  


==============================================================================================================================


If and ONLY if two inputs are true(1), then the output is true(1)


Therefore, if there is more than two true’s(1’s) or less than two true’s(1’s), then the output is false(0)


EX:  (This doesn’t include every single possible outp and inp)

Inputs:		Outputs:

1 0 1 0		1

1 1 0 0		1

0 0 1 1		1

0 1 0 1		1

1 0 0 1		1


0 0 0 1		0

1 1 1 0		0

0 0 0 0		0

0 1 1 1		0

1 1 1 1		0
