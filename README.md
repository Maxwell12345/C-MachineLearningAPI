# Four-Input-Exclisive-Gate-AI-Predictor___Dev-In-C-

A completely from scratch C++ developed AI predicts the output of a given set of specific inputs.  


======================================================================================


If and ONLY if two inputs are true(1), then the output is true(1)


Therefore, if there is more than two true’s(1’s) or less than two true’s(1’s), then the output is false(0)


## Example:  (This doesn’t include every single possible outp and inp)

Inputs: 1 0 1 0

Output: 1


Inputs: 1 1 0 0	

Output: 1


Inputs: 0 0 1 1	

Output: 1


Inputs: 0 1 0 1	

Output: 1


Inputs: 1 0 0 1	

Output: 1



Inputs: 1 0 1 1

Output: 0


Inputs: 0 1 0 1	

Output: 1


Inputs: 0 0 0 1

Output: 0


Inputs: 1 1 1 0		

Output:0


Inputs: 0 0 0 0

Output: 0
